* Complex networks, complex processes: A network science miscellany :PROJECT:

** Contents to write

*** Generating functions

*** Monte Carlo simulation

**** Synchronous

**** Gillespie


*** Disease models

**** Compartmented models

**** SIR, SIS, SEIR

     Focus on the differences, what they allow in terms of modelling
     and relationships to real diseases.

*** Opinion dynamics

*** Adaptive networks

    How does adaptation change things?

**** Addition-deletion networks

     The simplest kind. Maybe look at different kernels as well as the
     "standard" ones.

     See [[id:7c993ad2-f1ac-4e11-9e9a-439e1f6ceb2d][Exact solutions for models of evolving networks with addition
     and deletion of nodes]].


**** Epidemic dynamics on networks

     SIS epidemics show endemicity and changing epidemic thresholds as
     the degree of rewiring changes.
