<p>We now have all the bits we need to build an epidemic simulation. In this chapter we’ll develop a simulation of SIR in discrete time – that is to say, modelling the world at the granularity of some interval of time in which lots of independent events can occur. We’ll show how this simulation is put together using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">epydemic</span></code> library, making use of the compartmented model we coded earlier. And we’ll discuss some of the advantages of this approach – but also its limitations, which lead us into continuous-time suiimulation of the same model</p>

<p>Any simulation dynamics has to answer the three questions we posed <a class="reference internal" href="simulation.html#sec-simulation-coding"><span class="std std-ref">earlier</span></a>: <em>when</em> does an event happen?, <em>where</em> in the network?, and <em>which</em> action is taken? Synchronous dynamics has simple answers to these questions. At each discrete timestep (<em>when</em>) it looks for all the places in the network where an event <em>could</em> occur (<em>where</em>), and choose whether or not an event occurs at each place according to the probabilities given to the events by the probability distribution (<em>which</em>).</p>
<p>Providing this dynamics is simply a matter of turning this description into code:</p>

</div>
<p>That’s it! – one method called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">do()</span></code> that codes-up the simulation loop. While the simulation is not at equilibrium (as defined by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">at_equilibrium()</span></code> method inherited from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dynamics</span></code>) we retrieve the event distribution. For each entry we run-through all the possible places for an event and select randomly whether the event actually happens. We do this by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy.random.random()</span></code> function, which returns a random number uniformyl distributed over the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([0, 1]\)</span>. If this random number is less than the probability associated with the event, then we “fire” the event by calling the associated event function, passing it the dynamics, the current simulation time, the network over which the process is running, and the place where the event occurs (a node or an edge in the network). We keep track of the number of events we fire, and also keep track of the number of timesteps in which events are fired, which we’ll use later when we think about the efficiency of this kind of simulation.</p>
<p>At the end of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">do()</span></code> we package-up a short summary of the experiment as <strong>metadata</strong>: data about the way the simulation occured. We store this in a dict that we inherit from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">epyc.Experiment</span></code>, accessed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metadata()</span></code> method. Finally we return our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">experimentalResults()</span></code>, which is another method inherited from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">epyc.Experiment</span></code> that we’ll come back to in a moment.</p>
<div class="section" id="span-id-sec-epidemic-synchronous-pause-span-but-why-is-the-code-decomposed-this-way">
<h3><span id="sec_epidemic_synchronous_pause"></span> But why is the code decomposed this way?<a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-sec-epidemic-synchronous-pause-span-but-why-is-the-code-decomposed-this-way" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>That’s quite a lot of code, so let’s pause and assess what we’ve built.</p>
<p>First of all we defined the basic structures of an epidemic process on a network: basically the ability to generate a working copy of a network several times, some definition of termination, and an abstract method for getting the event distribution. We then specialised this to provide continuous-time simulation dynamics which takk the distribution and applied it to all possible places where events could occur according totheir probabilities. Rather than then specifying the event distributions and events by sub-classing, we instead bound the missing elements to an object defining a compartmented model of disease, allowing that to provide the details.</p>
<p>Why this way? – why not just sub-class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SynchronousDynamics</span></code> to provide, for example, the events of SIR and their distribution? The answer is that SIR is a process that can run on several <em>different</em> simulation regimes as well as this one, notably the stochastic dynamics we’ll look at later. If we defined SIR by sub-classing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SynchronousDynamics</span></code>, we’d then need to re-define it if we introduced another simulation dynamics: two definitions of the same process, which is an invitation to mistakes.</p>
<p>It’s far better to define a single process in a single class and then re-use it, wnd this is what we’ve done in defining the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CompartmentedModel</span></code> class and <a class="reference external" href="software-epydemic.ipynb#sec_software_epydemic_example_sir_model">sub-classing it to define SIR</a>. This makes the simulation framework easier to use, but trickier to implement: the astute reader will have noticed that we didn’t explain how <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CompartmentedModel</span></code> works inside, and that’s because it’s a bit complicated. But it’s also largely irrelevant in practice: you don’t need to know how this particular piece of code works in order to use it for network science experiments. (If you’re interested, you can look at the code in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/simoninireland/epydemic"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">epydemic</span></code>’s github repo</a>. But don’t say you weren’t warned.)</p>
<p>The message here is not that some simulation code is complicated, but rather that it’s possible to <em>localise</em> that complexity where it can’t do any harm. This keeps the user interface simpler and also means that we can now concentrate on the epidemics, not the code we use to simulate them.</p>

<h2><span id="sec_epidemic_synchronous_example"></span> Simulating SIR<a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-sec-epidemic-synchronous-example-span-simulating-sir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Finally, at long last, let’s run some code.</p>
<p>We have a compartmented model of SIR, and a synchronous discrete-time simulation framework, so let’s run the former in the latter. We first need to define the parameters of our simulation, and for this experiment we’ll use a small-ish ER network and some fairly nondescript SIR parameters:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># ER network parameters</span>
<span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ERNetwork</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5000</span>
<span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ERNetwork</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">KMEAN</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>

<span class="c1"># SIR parameters</span>
<span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">SIR</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">P_INFECTED</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.01</span>
<span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">SIR</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">P_INFECT</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span>
<span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">SIR</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">P_REMOVE</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can then create the network and the model, and bind them together with the simulation dynamics:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SIR</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">sim</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SynchronousDynamics</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ERNetwork</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To run the simulation we need to pass the parameters as a dict keyed by the names we used for them in the compartmented model description of SIR. We then set these as the parameters and run the simulation:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># run the simulation</span>
<span class="n">sync</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sim</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell_output docutils container">
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[]

<p>The simulation returns a Python dict which as refer to as a <strong>results dict</strong>. It’s structured in a very particular way, with three top-level keys:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sync</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">keys</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell_output docutils container">
<div class="output text_plain highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[&#39;parameters&#39;, &#39;metadata&#39;, &#39;results&#39;]
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results</span></code> key contains a dict of the experimental results that the simulation returned: it’s “real” results, if you like:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sync</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;results&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell_output docutils container">
<div class="output text_plain highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&#39;epydemic.SIR.S&#39;: 4945, &#39;epydemic.SIR.I&#39;: 55, &#39;epydemic.SIR.R&#39;: 0}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this case the results are a dict of compartments and their sizes, and a dict of loci and their sizes. We can see that in this case there are no infected nodes left, and therefore no SI edges – and therefore no way the simulation can infect any more nodes.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">parameters</span></code> key contains a dict of the parameters we passed to the simulation:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sync</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;parameters&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell_output docutils container">
<div class="output text_plain highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&#39;epydemic.generators.ER.N&#39;: 5000,
 &#39;epydemic.generators.ER.kmean&#39;: 5,
 &#39;epydemic.SIR.pInfected&#39;: 0.01,
 &#39;epydemic.SIR.pInfect&#39;: 0.2,
 &#39;epydemic.SIR.pRemove&#39;: 0.1}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So we have the experimental results and the simulation parameters that gave rise to the immediately to hand. Note that this isn’t <em>quite</em> all the information we might need, as it doesn’t include the size or link probability of the underlying network prototype we passed to the simulation.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metadata</span></code> key contains a dist of useful information about how the simulation progressed:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">

<p>These values might be important in assessing how the simulation worked. For the time being, let’s just draw attention to the difference between two values: the overall simulation time (20000 timesteps, the default), and the number of timesteps iun whichevents actually occurred. The former is <em>way</em> larger than the latter, suggesting that the simulation did an awful lot of … well, nothing.</p>
<p>We can easily check whether we had an epidemic by checking the size of the largest outbreak, which in the case of an epidemic should scale linearly with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code>, the size of the network:</p>

<p>The synchronous approach to simulation is easy for a programmer to understand, which of course is an enormous advantage. But it does have some important disadvantages too. There are two issues in particular, one programmatic and one mathematical, that can be better addressed by using a slightly different approach.</p>
<div class="section" id="performance-of-synchronous-simulation">
<h3>Performance of synchronous simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-of-synchronous-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The synchronous synamics we encoded above works by evaluating the process dynamics at each discrete timestep. This is an obvious approach, but one that begs two questions: how expensive is it to evaluate the dynamics at each step?; and, what proportion of timesteps do we evaluate the dynamics with no effect, because nothing changes?</p>
<p>To answer the first question we can look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">do()</span></code> method on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SynchronousDynamics</span></code>. At each timestep it retrieves all the places where an event might occur, which we know from our definition of SIR is any SI edge (for infection events) and any infected node (for removal events). For each place, it draws a random number and then possibly calls an event function. The amount of work therefore depends on the sizes of the two loci for events, which will presumably swell as the epidemic progresses: we might assume that in an average timestep about half the nodes are infected, and some smaller proportion of the edges are SI: we can’t say much more without a lot more information about the structure of the network. The loci change as events occur, which means that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CompartmentedModel</span></code> will have to ensure that it can efficiently track these changes (and indeed a lot of the code complexity addresses exactly this).</p>
<p>We alluded earlier to the answer to the second question. The result dict includes metadata that defines the number of timesteps and the number in which at least one event actually occurred. We can use these to determine the percentage of timesteps in which anything actually happened – and therefore calculate the “wasted” timesteps:</p>

<p>Even though “nothing happened” in those timesteps, we still performed computation to determine it, since we probabilistically tried to pass infection from each infected node to each of its susceptible neighbours. For certain parameter combinations – large, dense networks with long-running but not very transmissible infection, for example – this can result in a lot of extraneous computation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statistical-exactness">
<h3>Statistical exactness<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-exactness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A slightly more significant problem is one of statistical exactness: the extent to which the simulation actually performs according to the probabilities. We won;t dig into this in too much detail, but the basic problem is simple to explain. In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">do()</span></code> method, for each possible event, we collect the possible places the event can happen and then decide whether the event actually happens there. There’s a hidden assumption here that all these choices are independent of one another, but that’s not quite the case. For example, if two infected nodes are connected to the same susceptible node – so there are two SI edges in the locus for infection events – then we have two chances to infect the susceptible node in the same timestep. If the first time happens to result in infection then the second one can’t (by definition), making the actual rate of infections in a timestep varies just slightly from the expected value. Similarly, we may happen to run the removal events before the infection events, and so nodes infected in the timestep don’ty have any possibility of recovering in that same timestep – even if the probability of recovery were set very high.</p>
<p>If these sound like trivial issues, well they may well be. But they may <em>not</em> be, depending on the exact combinations of parameters and network structures we encounter. That’s a risk it’d be better not to take, as it introduces patterns into the simulation results that aren’t there  the model descriptions, or indeed in any mathematical analysis we might make of them.</p>
<p>It might be that we’re willing to accept these issues in the interests of simplicity: synchronous simulation is very easy to program and understand. But both the performance and the statistical exactness issues are caused by the same basic decision to use discrete time, and it turns out that we can address both by using a different simulation dynamics, one that works directly from the probability distributions in continuous time.</p>
